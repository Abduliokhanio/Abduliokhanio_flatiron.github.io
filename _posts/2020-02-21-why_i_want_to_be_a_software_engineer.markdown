          There are a lot of reasons to become a software engineer. Everyone has their own end goal in this “game of life”. In this short blog post I’ll go ahead and walk you through why I concluded that becoming a software engineer would be the best choice for me and why it will most likely be the best choice for you. If you don’t want to learn about me and are looking for a quick summary, I recommend skipping to the very last 3 paragraphs of this post. But you’ll miss out on my amazing writing skills. Not only that but you’ll miss the cryptic messages I’ve hidden within these passages to solve the riddle in the final paragraph. Otherwise; I hope you enjoy the post!

          A little about me. Let’s flash back to the amazing year of 2013. Ahh, yes what a time. The Harlem shake was cool, meme’s had just become a mainstream popular, and I had a white, shiny, used I-phone 4 that I used to jam “Pierce the Veil” albums to during my down time. My favorite band at the time. I was 18, I had just graduated High School and I was in the process of signing up for college. I didn’t know what I wanted to be in life, but I knew that I wanted to do have an impact in the world. 
	
          College was expensive. I spent the spent the first 2 years of my college life trying to find a job that’ll pay for college. A job that didn’t pay minimum wage! I was unsuccessfully bouncing from one minimum wage job to another that promised “Growth Opportunities”. Barely making ends meet. Upon doing so I concluded that you need a piece of paper to be considered for “Growth Opportunities” and jobs that pay salary. That piece of paper is called a “college degree”.  
					
          I unwisely and logistically decided that I needed to get out of school “As Soon As Possible”. Fast forward to graduation date. I had spent the last 2 years working overnight (12AM -7AM) in an IT department while perusing a Marketing degree during the day (class time varied from semester to semester; but it was for the most part around 8am- 4pm). With great difficulty I had received my “piece of paper” but I felt so far from my goal. 
					
          While I had received full time offers; they were obviously unsatisfying. Please if anything ingrain these words into your head: 
“YOU CAN’T CHANGE THE WORLD OR LIVE A MEANINGFUL LIFE WORKING IN CALL CENTER/HELP DESK/BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT/APPOINTMENT SETTING (its where you cold-call to make appointments for people who actually makes sales. Yes, it’s an actual job and yes it’s a terrible job; I’ve done it before)/ WORK!”

          Its common sense. Luckily, I predicted this. My “piece of paper” is a stepping stone to help me get a salary-based job to peruse something that I believe will help me have an impact on the world. Software Engineering. 
					
          We live at such an exciting point in time. Humans are trying to colonize space. We are developing nano-bot technology. We are building virtual world we can explore with VR goggles [i.e. VR CHAT GAME]. We have developed algorithms that imitate human thinking [i.e. neural networks]. AND we have access to the internet in the palm of our hands. And the crazy part is that this is just the beginning. Who knows how many undiscovered billion-dollar business will be built from this point in time moving forward; as humans’ transition to becoming a space-faring civilization? 
					
          I guess what I’m trying to say is that if you want to make an impact AND do meaningful work. Software Engineering is where it’s at. But if you don’t care about all that. And you just want a job that pays a high salary. That’s cool to. I’m not here to judge. I like money just as much as Mr. Monopoly from the board games. Software Engineer also have one of the highest salary rates in the world.  With median pay being around 6 figures and a ridiculously low unemployment rate. https://insights.dice.com/2019/07/19/tech-unemployment-hits-19-year-low/
	 
          I understand that you can become a doctor or a surgeon to receive a high paying, secure job to do meaningful work. It personally just wasn’t a good fit for me. I wasn’t able to justify the 8+ additional years of school after high school; AND surmounting a debt of around $120K while working 40-80 hours a week in residency for around $50k a year for next couple of years. Especially when I struggled to barely graduate with a marketing degree due to lack of funding. 

          In conclusion I decided to become a software engineer because I haven’t given up on my desire to have an impact in the world. On that note; when presented with a six-figure salary, high levels of job security and low barrier of entry (at least when compared to doctors/surgeons) it was an obvious next step in life. 

Author’s Notes:
As you may have guessed there isn’t a cryptic message hidden within these passages (Or was there???). But if anything; hopefully this blog post gave you in insight as to why I chose Software Engineering as a career and inspired you to pursue this quest with me. You’re not getting younger. Today is all you have.
